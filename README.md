# Haze removal
This repository holds a course project for EL-GY 6123 Image and Video Processing given by professor Yao Wang at New York University. 
Haze (or fog, mist, and other atmospheric phenomena) is a main degradation of outdoor images, weakening both colors and contrasts.
In this project, we explore ways of haze removal or dehazing.
